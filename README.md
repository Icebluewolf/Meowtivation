A productivity and self care bot focused on building tighter communities.
Oh and there is cats with cookies.

## Description
Meowtivation if focused on allowing you to complete your goals and daily tasks. 
Users will be able to add one time tasks or reoccurring tasks. 
For example, "Clean my room" or "Drink 3 glasses of water everyday". 
Users can set a privacy setting on the task for it to show globally, in the guild it was created, or only to them. 
Users can also set a reward value for completing the task. 
Once a task is completed the user can redeem their rewards in a self made shop. 
That is right, each user will have their own shop that they can setup and put rewards like 
    "Eat a cookie" or "30 extra minutes of gaming". 
Want to take an advance on a reward go ahead, the Meowtivation is not here to control your life, its here to help. 
The beauty with this system is it gives the user full control over what is important to them.

But Wolfy, you said that this bot is for building righter communities...\
Yup, what better way to stay motivated than have your friends invested in helping you do just that. 
Whenever you complete a task you will get some points. 
You can spend these points to boost the reward value of another users task. 
A notion that you care about them, and want them to succeed as well. 
Do you know that your friend needs to get something done but they have not created a task for it? 
You can create a task for them, that they can accept or deny. 

Is there a leaderboard?
No! Meowtivation is gamified and has a point system but there is no leaderboard. 
Everyone has different lifestyles and amounts of time. 
The goal is for **you** to feel good about yourself, your productivity compared to others does not matter. 
This will also promote meaningful tasks and not low effort tasks to gain points.

## Technology
Meowtivation is made with Py-cord in Python. It uses a Postgres database.
As of know most of the art is from free to use assets online.
